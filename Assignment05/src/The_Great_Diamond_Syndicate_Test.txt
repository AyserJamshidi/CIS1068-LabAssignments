The place was small, and cheap, and dirty. In the way of furniture
it contained only a flat bed, a spotted washstand, a chair, and
an old dresser. The detectives sent the janitor away, much to his
disappointment, and made a careful study of the place.

“Here’s more red hair,” said Chick. “I wonder if this is bleached?”

Examination showed that it was. Nick took several articles from the
chest and the top of the dresser and carried them away with him.

“If the room was hired for the purpose of getting rid of the boy,” said
Chick, as the detectives walked away, “why should it have been taken
yesterday? The boy was not in the game at that time.”
